# Introduction

Tripper Travel App is a fullstack application designed to be a travel planner and travel inspiration board attached to your own user account. The primary features include the ability to login or create a new account, create a new trip that fetches data from a travel API that consists of flights, hotels, and points of interests specific to the dates you set and your destination, and the ability to save, delete, or book these trips. 
This was a passion project for myself becuase I am always looking for my next trip and would love a one-stop shop to make all necessary plans in one place.
